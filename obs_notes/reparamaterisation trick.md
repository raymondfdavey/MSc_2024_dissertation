going from 
$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$$

to 
$$x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$

 Utilizes the reparameterization trick. It is an alternative way to express the probablistic forward diffusion process, and it provides a way to generate samples from the transition probability distribution $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$.

The reparameterization trick is a technique used in variational inference and generative models to express a random variable that follows a specific distribution as a deterministic function of another random variable with a simpler distribution (often a standard Gaussian).

In the context of the diffusion model, the reparameterization trick allows us to express $x_t$, which follows the Gaussian distribution $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$, as a deterministic function of $x_{t-1}$ and a random variable $\epsilon_t$ that follows a standard Gaussian distribution.

Let's break down the equation:

$x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$

- $\sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}$ is the deterministic scaling term that preserves a fraction of the previous timestep's data $x_{t-1}$. The scaling factor $\sqrt{1-\beta_t}$ controls how much of $x_{t-1}$ is retained.

- $\sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t$ is the stochastic Gaussian noise term. It adds random noise to the deterministic term to generate the next timestep's data $x_t$. The scaling factor $\sqrt{\beta_t}$ controls the magnitude of the noise.

- $\epsilon_t$ is a random variable sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$. It introduces randomness into the generation of $x_t$.

By using the reparameterization trick, we can express $x_t$ as a deterministic function of $x_{t-1}$ and $\epsilon_t$, while still maintaining the desired Gaussian distribution $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$. This is because the sum of a Gaussian random variable ($\sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t$) and a constant ($\sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}$) is also Gaussian-distributed.

The reparameterization trick has several advantages:

1. It allows for the separation of the deterministic and stochastic parts of the generative process, making it easier to understand and interpret.

2. It enables the use of standard backpropagation for training the model, as the random variable $\epsilon_t$ is independent of the model parameters. This is because the randomness is introduced through $\epsilon_t$, which is sampled from a fixed distribution.

3. It provides a way to generate samples from the transition probability distribution $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ by first sampling $\epsilon_t$ from a standard Gaussian and then applying the deterministic transformation.

The reparameterization trick is commonly used in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and other generative models to enable efficient training and sampling. In the context of diffusion models, it provides an alternative and intuitive way to express the forward diffusion process and generate samples from the transition probability distributions.

ME: I'm not quite sure why the reparamaterisation trick 'allows for sampling' like you say, could you explain this a bit more please

Answ:
Certainly! Let me explain how the reparameterization trick allows for sampling from the transition probability distribution in more detail.

Consider the original form of the transition probability distribution:
$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$$

To sample $x_t$ from this distribution, we would need to directly sample from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}$ and covariance matrix $\beta_t \mathbf{I}$. However, this sampling process depends on the value of $x_{t-1}$, which can make the sampling and training process more complex.

Now, let's consider the reparameterized form:
$$x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$

In this form, we express $x_t$ as a deterministic function of $x_{t-1}$ and a random variable $\epsilon_t$ that follows a standard Gaussian distribution. The key idea is that $\epsilon_t$ is independent of $x_{t-1}$ and can be sampled separately.

To generate a sample $x_t$ from the transition probability distribution using the reparameterized form, we follow these steps:
1. Sample $\epsilon_t$ from the standard Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$.
2. Compute $x_t$ using the deterministic transformation: $x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t$.

By sampling $\epsilon_t$ from a standard Gaussian distribution and then applying the deterministic transformation, we effectively sample $x_t$ from the desired transition probability distribution $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$.

The reparameterization trick allows for this two-step sampling process, where the randomness is introduced through the independent variable $\epsilon_t$, and the deterministic transformation ensures that $x_t$ follows the desired Gaussian distribution.

The main advantages of using the reparameterization trick for sampling are:
1. It separates the source of randomness ($\epsilon_t$) from the deterministic part of the transformation, making the sampling process more straightforward.
2. It allows for the use of standard backpropagation during training because the gradients can flow through the deterministic part of the transformation, while the randomness is introduced by $\epsilon_t$, which is independent of the model parameters.
3. It provides a way to generate samples from the transition probability distribution without directly sampling from a Gaussian distribution that depends on the value of $x_{t-1}$.

In summary, the reparameterization trick allows for sampling from the transition probability distribution by expressing $x_t$ as a deterministic function of $x_{t-1}$ and an independent random variable $\epsilon_t$. This formulation simplifies the sampling process and enables efficient training of the diffusion model.

ME: Why would it be hard without this trick is X_t-1 needs to be known for both?

ANSW:

I apologize for any confusion in my previous explanation. You're absolutely right that in both the original form and the reparameterized form, the value of $x_{t-1}$ needs to be known to generate $x_t$. Let me clarify the main advantage of using the reparameterization trick in this context.

In the original form of the transition probability distribution:
$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$$

To sample $x_t$, we need to know the value of $x_{t-1}$ because it determines the mean of the Gaussian distribution from which $x_t$ is sampled. This means that the sampling process is directly dependent on the specific value of $x_{t-1}$.

Now, let's consider the reparameterized form:
$$x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$

In this form, $x_t$ is still dependent on $x_{t-1}$, as it appears in the deterministic part of the transformation. However, the key difference is that the random component $\epsilon_t$ is sampled independently from a standard Gaussian distribution, regardless of the value of $x_{t-1}$.

The main advantage of the reparameterization trick lies in the fact that it separates the deterministic and stochastic parts of the sampling process, which can be beneficial for training the model and computing gradients.

In the reparameterized form, the gradients of the model parameters with respect to the loss function can be computed more easily because the randomness is introduced through $\epsilon_t$, which is independent of the model parameters. The gradients can flow through the deterministic part of the transformation ($\sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}$) without being affected by the stochastic sampling of $\epsilon_t$.

In contrast, in the original form, the sampling of $x_t$ is directly dependent on the Gaussian distribution parameters, which are a function of $x_{t-1}$. This can make the computation of gradients more challenging, especially when using techniques like backpropagation.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation. You are correct that in both forms, the value of $x_{t-1}$ is needed to generate $x_t$. The main benefit of the reparameterization trick is that it separates the deterministic and stochastic parts of the sampling process, which can simplify the computation of gradients during training.
