OVERVIEW:
Certainly! Let's summarize the steps in developing a loss term for the diffusion process using a concrete example of a particle moving through time.

The diffusion process:
Imagine a particle that starts at an initial position x_0 and moves through time according to a diffusion process. At each time step t, the particle's position x_t is corrupted by adding Gaussian noise, which is controlled by the diffusion process parameters (e.g., α_t, β_t). As time progresses, the particle's position becomes increasingly noisy, and the original position x_0 becomes harder to discern. The forward diffusion process is defined by the transition probabilities q(x_t|x_{t-1}), which describe how the particle moves from one time step to the next.

The reverse process:
The goal of the diffusion model is to learn the reverse process, which starts from the noisy particle position x_T at the final time step T and progressively denoises it to recover the original position x_0. The reverse process is defined by the transition probabilities p_θ(x_{t-1}|x_t), which describe how the particle moves backward in time from a noisy position to a less noisy one. The reverse process is parameterized by θ, which represents the learnable parameters of the model (e.g., neural network weights).

Modeling the loss term:
To learn the reverse process, we need to define a loss function that encourages the model to generate samples that are similar to the original data distribution. In the diffusion model, this is achieved by minimizing the variational upper bound $\bar{L}$ on the negative log-likelihood:

$$\bar{L} = -\mathbb{E}_q\left[\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right]$$

Here, $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ represents the joint probability of the particle's positions from time step 0 to T under the reverse process, and $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ represents the joint probability of the particle's positions from time step 1 to T under the forward diffusion process, conditioned on the initial position x_0.

Expanding the loss term:
The authors expand the variational upper bound $\bar{L}$ into a sum of KL divergence terms and a log-likelihood term:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{L} & =\mathbb{E}_q\left(D_{KL}\left(q\left(x_T \mid x_0\right) \| p\left(x_T\right)\right)+\sum_{t=2}^T D_{KL}\left(q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right) \| p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)\right)-\log p_\theta\left(x_0 \mid x_1\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Each term in this expansion has a specific meaning:

- $D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) || p(x_T))$: This term encourages the final noisy position x_T to be close to the prior distribution p(x_T), which is typically chosen to be a standard Gaussian distribution.
- $\sum_{t=2}^T D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) || p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t))$: These terms encourage the reverse transition probabilities p_θ(x_{t-1}|x_t) to be close to the true reverse transition probabilities q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0), which are derived from the forward diffusion process.
- $-\log p_\theta(x_0|x_1)$: This term encourages the model to assign a high probability to the original particle position x_0 given the first denoised position x_1.

By minimizing the variational upper bound $\bar{L}$, the diffusion model learns to generate particle trajectories that are similar to the original data distribution.

Sampling from the learned model:
Once the model is trained, we can generate new particle trajectories by sampling from the learned reverse process. Starting from a random noisy position x_T sampled from the prior distribution p(x_T), we iteratively apply the learned reverse transition probabilities p_θ(x_{t-1}|x_t) to denoise the particle's position step by step until we reach the initial position x_0. The resulting trajectory represents a plausible particle motion according to the learned data distribution.

In summary, the diffusion model learns to generate particle trajectories by minimizing a loss term that consists of KL divergence terms and a log-likelihood term. The KL divergence terms encourage the reverse process to match the true reverse process derived from the forward diffusion process, while the log-likelihood term encourages the model to assign high probabilities to the original particle positions. By minimizing this loss, the model learns to generate plausible particle trajectories that resemble the original data distribution.

Ok as the loss is the real fucker We will go through the article and the reasoning here:
We want to find $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ that minimise $$L = \arg\min_{\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta} D_{KL}(q(x_0) || p_\theta(x_0))$$ $$L= \arg\min_{\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta} \left(-\int q(x_0) \log\left(\frac{p_\theta(x_0)}{q(x_0)}\right) dx_0\right)$$ $$L= \arg\min_{\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta} \left(- \int q(x_0) \log p_\theta(x_0) dx_0\right)$$

Now, let's go through each step:

1. a) The goal is to find the parameters $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ of the reverse process that minimize the KL divergence between the true data distribution $q(x_0)$ and the distribution of the generated samples $p_\theta(x_0)$. This is expressed using the $\arg\min$ operator, which returns the arguments ($\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$) that minimize the given function (the KL divergence). 
1. b) The KL divergence is used as a loss function because it measures the difference between two probability distributions. In this case, it quantifies the difference between the true data distribution $q(x_0)$ and the distribution of the generated samples $p_\theta(x_0)$. The KL divergence is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if the two distributions are equal almost everywhere. By minimizing the KL divergence, we are effectively finding the parameters $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ that make the generated sample distribution as close as possible to the true data distribution.
2. The KL divergence is defined as: $$D_{KL}(q(x_0) || p_\theta(x_0)) = -\int q(x_0) \log\left(\frac{p_\theta(x_0)}{q(x_0)}\right) dx_0$$ This is the integral form of the KL divergence, where we integrate over all possible values of $x_0$. The integrand is the product of $q(x_0)$ and the negative logarithm of the ratio between $p_\theta(x_0)$ and $q(x_0)$. The negative sign is used in [[variational inference application]] of KL divergence
3. a) In the third equation, the authors simplify the KL divergence by keeping only the term that depends on $p_\theta(x_0)$. This is because the term $\int q(x_0) \log q(x_0) dx_0$ does not depend on the parameters $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$, and thus can be omitted from the optimization objective. 
3. b) The simplification steps are as follows: $$-\int q(x_0) \log\left(\frac{p_\theta(x_0)}{q(x_0)}\right) dx_0$$ $$= -\int q(x_0) \left(\log p_\theta(x_0) - \log q(x_0)\right) dx_0$$ $$= -\int q(x_0) \log p_\theta(x_0) dx_0 + \int q(x_0) \log q(x_0) dx_0$$ The second term $\int q(x_0) \log q(x_0) dx_0$ does not depend on $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$, so it can be omitted from the optimization objective, resulting in: $$\arg\min_{\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta} \left(- \int q(x_0) \log p_\theta(x_0) dx_0\right)$$

In summary, the objective is to find the parameters $\mu_\theta$ and $\Sigma_\theta$ that minimize the negative log-likelihood of the generated samples under the true data distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the generated sample distribution, which measures the difference between the two distributions and serves as a loss function for optimizing the reverse process parameters.
***

$$L = - \int q(x_0) \log (p_\theta(x_0)) dx_0$$ $$L = - \int q(x_0) \log \left(\int p_\theta(x_{0:T}) dx_{1:T}\right) dx_0$$ $$L = - \int q(x_0) \log \left(\int \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)} q(x_{1:T}|x_0) dx_{1:T}\right) dx_0$$

Now, let's go through each step:

1. The first equation is the simplified loss function derived in the previous steps. It represents the negative log-likelihood of the generated samples under the true data distribution.
2. In the second equation, the authors expand the term $\log p_\theta(x_0)$ using the marginal probability formula: $$p_\theta(x_0) = \int p_\theta(x_{0:T}) dx_{1:T}$$ where $x_{0:T}$ denotes the entire trajectory of the reverse process, and $x_{1:T}$ denotes the trajectory excluding the initial point $x_0$. This expansion is necessary because the joint probability $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ is what the reverse process actually models, while the loss function only involves the marginal probability $p_\theta(x_0)$. 
3. a) The marginal probability formula is derived from the basic principles of probability theory, specifically the concept of marginalization. In the context of the diffusion model, $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ represents the joint probability distribution of the entire reverse process trajectory, from the final state $x_T$ back to the initial state $x_0$. This joint probability can be factorized as: $$p_\theta(x_{0:T}) = p(x_T) \prod_{t=1}^T p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$$ b) To obtain the marginal probability distribution $p_\theta(x_0)$, we need to [[integrate out]] all the intermediate states $x_{1:T}$ from the joint probability distribution. This is done by applying the marginalization principle: $$p_\theta(x_0) = \int p_\theta(x_{0:T}) dx_{1:T}$$ Here, $dx_{1:T}$ represents the integration over all possible values of the intermediate states $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_T$.
4. In the third equation, the authors introduce the forward process distribution $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ into the integral. This is done by multiplying and dividing the integrand by $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$: $$\int p_\theta(x_{0:T}) dx_{1:T} = \int \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)} q(x_{1:T}|x_0) dx_{1:T}$$ a) The reason for introducing the forward process distribution is to express the loss function in terms of a ratio between the reverse process joint probability $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ and the forward process conditional probability $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$. This ratio will be important in the subsequent steps for deriving a tractable optimization objective. 
5. b) It's worth noting that introducing $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ does not change the value of the integral, as it cancels out when multiplied and divided by the same term. However, it sets the stage for the application of Jensen's inequality in the next steps.

In summary, these steps expand the loss function in terms of the joint probability of the entire reverse process trajectory $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ and introduce the forward process distribution $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$. The marginal probability formula is used to relate the joint probability to the marginal probability $p_\theta(x_0)$, which appears in the loss function. This formulation will be used in the subsequent steps to derive a tractable upper bound on the loss function using Jensen's inequality.

***
The equations in the paper are:

$$L = - \int q(x_0) \log\left( \int \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}q(x_{1:T}|x_0) dx_{1:T} \right)dx_0$$ $$L \leq - \int q(x_0) \left(\int \log \left( \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right)q(x_{1:T}|x_0) dx_{1:T}\right)dx_0$$ $$L\leq - \int q(x_{0:T}) \log \left(\frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) dx_{0:T}$$ $$L \leq \mathbb{E}_q \left(- \log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) = \bar{L}$$

Now, let's go through the derivation step by step:

1. The first equation is the loss function $L$ expressed as an integral over $q(x_0)$. Inside the logarithm, we have the ratio of the joint distribution $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ and the conditional distribution $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$, multiplied by $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ and integrated over $x_{1:T}$.
2. In the second equation, the authors apply Jensen's inequality to move the logarithm inside the integral over $x_{1:T}$. This is valid because the logarithm is a concave function, and Jensen's inequality states that for a concave function $f$ and a random variable $X$: $$f(\mathbb{E}[X]) \geq \mathbb{E}[f(X)]$$ In this case, $f$ is the logarithm function, and $X$ is $\frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}$.
3. In the third equation, the authors combine the two integrals into a single integral over the joint distribution $q(x_{0:T}) = q(x_0)q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$. This is a valid operation because: $$\int q(x_0) \left(\int f(x_{0:T}) q(x_{1:T}|x_0)dx_{1:T}\right) dx_0$$$$ = \int f(x_{0:T}) q(x_0)q(x_{1:T}|x_0) dx_{0:T} $$$$= \int f(x_{0:T}) q(x_{0:T}) dx_{0:T}$$ where $f(x_{0:T}) = \log \left(\frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right)$.
4. Finally, in the fourth equation, the authors rewrite the integral as an expectation under the joint distribution $q(x_{0:T})$. This is simply a notation change, as the expectation of a function $f(x)$ under a distribution $p(x)$ is defined as: $$\mathbb{E}_p[f(x)] = \int f(x) p(x) dx$$ Therefore, we can write: $$- \int q(x_{0:T}) \log \left(\frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) dx_{0:T} = \mathbb{E}_q \left(- \log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right)$$ The authors denote this expectation as $\bar{L}$, which serves as an upper bound on the original loss function $L$.
***
Certainly! Let's explain what the authors are doing in each section, focusing on the mathematical shortcuts, tricks, or simplifications they are using and why they might be doing it in the diffusion context.

Section 1:
$$\bar{L} = \mathbb{E}_{q}\left(-\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) = \mathbb{E}_{q}\left(-\log \frac{p(x_T)\Pi_{t=1}^{T}p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)}{q(x_1|x_0)\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)}\right)$$

In this section, the authors are expanding the expression for the upper bound $\bar{L}$ by factorizing the joint distributions $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ and $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ using the product rule of probability.

1. They factorize $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ as $p(x_T)\Pi_{t=1}^{T}p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$, where:
   - $p(x_T)$ is the prior distribution of the final state $x_T$.
   - $\Pi_{t=1}^{T}p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ is the product of reverse transition probabilities from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$ for each time step $t$.

2. They factorize $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ as $q(x_1|x_0)\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)$, where:
   - $q(x_1|x_0)$ is the forward transition probability from $x_0$ to $x_1$.
   - $\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)$ is the product of forward transition probabilities from $x_{t-1}$ to $x_t$ conditioned on $x_0$ for each time step $t$.

In the diffusion context, this factorization allows the authors to express the forward and reverse processes as a sequence of transitions between states, which is a key aspect of diffusion models.

Section 2:
$$q(x_1|x_0)\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)=q(x_1|x_0)\Pi_{t=2}^{T}\frac{q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)q(x_t|x_0)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_0)} = q(x_T|x_0)\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$$

In this section, the authors are manipulating the expression for $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ to express it in terms of the reverse transition probabilities $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$.

1. They start with the factorized form of $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ from the previous section: $q(x_1|x_0)\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)$.

2. For each term $q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)$ in the product, they apply Bayes' theorem to express it in terms of the reverse transition probability $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$:
   
   $q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0) = \frac{q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)q(x_t|x_0)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}$

3. After substituting this expression back into the product, they observe that the terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out telescopically, leaving only $q(x_T|x_0)$ in the numerator and $\Pi_{t=2}^{T}q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ in the denominator.

The purpose of this manipulation is to express $q(x_{1:T}|x_0)$ in terms of the reverse transition probabilities $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, which is useful in the context of diffusion models because the reverse process is typically learned during training. By expressing the forward process in terms of the reverse transition probabilities, the authors can relate the learning objective to the reverse process.

In summary, the authors are using probabilistic reasoning and manipulations to express the forward and reverse processes in a way that is amenable to learning in the diffusion model framework.

***
In this section, the authors are further simplifying the expression for the upper bound $\bar{L}$ and expressing it in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences. Let's go through the steps and discuss the simplifications and mathematical inferences they are using.

Step 1:
$$\bar{L} =\mathbb{E}_q\left(-\log \frac{p\left(x_T\right)}{q\left(x_T \mid x_0\right)}-\sum_{t=2}^T \log \frac{p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)}{q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right)}-\log p_\theta\left(x_0 \mid x_1\right)\right)$$

1. The authors start with the expression for $\bar{L}$ from the previous section and split the logarithm of the product into a sum of logarithms using the properties of logarithms: $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$.

2. They separate the terms inside the expectation into three parts:
   - $-\log \frac{p\left(x_T\right)}{q\left(x_T \mid x_0\right)}$: This term compares the prior distribution $p(x_T)$ with the marginal distribution $q(x_T|x_0)$.
   - $-\sum_{t=2}^T \log \frac{p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)}{q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right)}$: This term compares the reverse transition probabilities $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ with the reverse transition probabilities conditioned on $x_0$, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, for each time step $t$ from $2$ to $T$.
   - $-\log p_\theta\left(x_0 \mid x_1\right)$: This term evaluates the reverse transition probability from $x_1$ to $x_0$.

Step 2:
$$\bar{L} =\mathbb{E}_q\left(D_{KL}\left(q\left(x_T \mid x_0\right) \| p\left(x_T\right)\right)+\sum_{t=2}^T D_{KL}\left(q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right) \| p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)\right)-\log p_\theta\left(x_0 \mid x_1\right)\right)$$

1. The authors recognize that the first two terms inside the expectation have the form of KL divergences:
   - $D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) \| p(x_T)) = -\log \frac{p(x_T)}{q(x_T|x_0)}$
   - $D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) \| p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)) = -\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)}$

2. They replace these terms with their corresponding KL divergence expressions.

The purpose of expressing the upper bound in terms of KL divergences is to provide a clear interpretation of what the model is trying to optimize:

- The first term $D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) \| p(x_T))$ encourages the marginal distribution of the final state $q(x_T|x_0)$ to be close to the prior distribution $p(x_T)$.

- The second term $\sum_{t=2}^T D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) \| p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t))$ encourages the learned reverse transition probabilities $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ to be close to the true reverse transition probabilities conditioned on $x_0$, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, for each time step.

- The third term $-\log p_\theta(x_0|x_1)$ encourages the model to assign high probability to the true initial state $x_0$ given the first state $x_1$ in the reverse process.

By minimizing this upper bound, the diffusion model learns to generate samples that are close to the true data distribution while following the reverse diffusion process.

***
finally

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the final section and provide a more detailed explanation of what the authors are presenting and why it is important in the context of diffusion models. We'll start by restating the equations and then break down the explanation.

Equations:
$$
p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(x_{t-1} ; \mu_\theta\left(x_t, t\right), \Sigma_\theta\left(x_t, t\right)\right)
$$
$$
q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(x_{t-1} ; \mu_t\left(x_t, x_0\right), \Sigma_t\right)$$ 
$$
\mu_t\left(x_t, x_0\right)=\frac{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \beta_t}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0+\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t}\left(1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}\right)}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} x_t \quad$$ 
$$\Sigma_t=\frac{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \beta_t
$$

Explanation:
In this final section, the authors are specifying the form of the reverse transition probability $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and the true reverse transition probability conditioned on $x_0$, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$. These probabilities are crucial for understanding how the diffusion model learns to generate data and how it is used for sampling.

1. Reverse transition probability $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$:
   - The authors assume that $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ and covariance $\Sigma_\theta(x_t, t)$.
   - The mean and covariance are modeled as functions of the current state $x_t$ and the time step $t$. In practice, these functions are typically implemented using neural networks, which allows the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships between the current state and the previous state.
   - By assuming a Gaussian form for $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$, the authors simplify the learning process, as Gaussian distributions have well-known mathematical properties and are easy to parameterize.
   - During training, the model learns the parameters of the neural networks that define $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ and $\Sigma_\theta(x_t, t)$ by minimizing the upper bound $\bar{L}$ derived in the previous sections.

2. True reverse transition probability conditioned on $x_0$, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$:
   - The authors also assume that $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ follows a Gaussian distribution, but with mean $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and covariance $\Sigma_t$.
   - Unlike $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$, the mean and covariance of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ are not learned functions, but are instead determined by the diffusion process itself.
   - The expressions for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$ are derived from the properties of the diffusion process and the Gaussian distributions used in the model:
     - The mean $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ is a weighted sum of the initial data $x_0$ and the current state $x_t$, where the weights depend on the diffusion process parameters ($\alpha_t$, $\beta_t$, and their cumulative products $\bar{\alpha}_t$). This expression ensures that the reverse process gradually removes the noise and recovers the initial data.
     - The covariance $\Sigma_t$ is a function of the diffusion process parameters and determines the amount of noise present at each time step. The specific form of $\Sigma_t$ is chosen to ensure that the reverse process is stable and well-behaved.
   - By deriving these expressions from the properties of the diffusion process and the Gaussian distributions, the authors ensure that $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ is consistent with the forward diffusion process and can be used to define the learning objective (the upper bound $\bar{L}$) for training the model.

The importance of specifying these distributions lies in several aspects:

1. Tractability: By assuming Gaussian forms for both $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, the authors make the learning process more tractable. Gaussian distributions have closed-form expressions for many important quantities, such as the KL divergence, which appears in the upper bound $\bar{L}$.

2. Consistency with the diffusion process: The expressions for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$ are derived from the properties of the diffusion process, ensuring that the reverse transition probability $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ is consistent with the forward process. This consistency is crucial for learning a meaningful reverse process that can generate realistic data.

3. Defining the learning objective: By specifying the form of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, the authors can calculate the KL divergence terms in the upper bound $\bar{L}$, which serves as the learning objective for training the model. Minimizing $\bar{L}$ encourages the learned reverse transition probability $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ to be close to the true reverse transition probability $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, which is necessary for generating high-quality samples.

4. Sampling process: Once the model is trained, the learned reverse transition probability $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ is used to generate new data samples. The sampling process starts from the prior distribution $p(x_T)$ and iteratively samples from the learned reverse transition probabilities until reaching the initial state $x_0$. The Gaussian form of $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ makes this sampling process straightforward and efficient.

In summary, the authors specify the form of the reverse transition probabilities $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ to make the learning process tractable, ensure consistency with the diffusion process, define a meaningful learning objective, and enable efficient sampling. By carefully designing these distributions based on the properties of the diffusion process and the Gaussian assumptions, the authors lay the foundation for a powerful and flexible generative model that can be trained to produce high-quality samples from complex data distributions.

The final section, where the authors specify the form of the reverse transition probabilities $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, is closely related to the concepts and equations discussed earlier in the paper. Let's recap the main points and see how this final section fits into the overall picture.

1. Diffusion process and reverse process:
   - The paper starts by introducing the concept of diffusion models, where a forward diffusion process gradually adds noise to the data, and the goal is to learn the reverse process that can generate clean data from the noisy versions.
   - The forward process is defined by the transition probabilities $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$, while the reverse process is defined by the transition probabilities $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$.

2. Variational bound and learning objective:
   - The authors derive a variational bound $\bar{L}$ on the negative log-likelihood of the data, which serves as the learning objective for training the diffusion model.
   - The variational bound $\bar{L}$ involves the KL divergence between the true reverse transition probability conditioned on $x_0$, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, and the learned reverse transition probability $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$.
   - Minimizing $\bar{L}$ encourages the learned reverse transition probability to be close to the true reverse transition probability, which is necessary for generating high-quality samples.

3. Tractable expressions for the transition probabilities:
   - To make the learning process tractable and enable the calculation of the KL divergence terms in $\bar{L}$, the authors need to specify the form of the transition probabilities $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$.
   - This is where the final section comes into play. By assuming Gaussian forms for both $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, the authors can derive closed-form expressions for the KL divergence and simplify the learning process.

4. Consistency with the diffusion process:
   - The expressions for the mean and covariance of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ are derived from the properties of the diffusion process, ensuring that the true reverse transition probability is consistent with the forward process.
   - This consistency is crucial for learning a meaningful reverse process that can generate realistic data.

5. Sampling process:
   - Once the model is trained, the learned reverse transition probability $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ is used to generate new data samples.
   - The Gaussian form of $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$, as specified in the final section, makes the sampling process straightforward and efficient.

In summary, the final section, where the authors specify the form of the reverse transition probabilities, is a crucial piece of the puzzle that ties together the concepts introduced earlier in the paper. By assuming Gaussian forms for the transition probabilities, the authors ensure that the learning process is tractable, the model is consistent with the diffusion process, and the sampling process is efficient. This section provides the necessary details to bridge the gap between the theoretical framework and the practical implementation of diffusion models.

The authors then write, 'and so' and then the following: $$ \begin{aligned} \bar{L} & =\mathbb{E}_q\left(-\log \frac{p\left(x_T\right)}{q\left(x_T \mid x_0\right)}-\sum_{t=2}^T \log \frac{p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)}{q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right)}-\log p_\theta\left(x_0 \mid x_1\right)\right) \\ & =\mathbb{E}_q\left(D_{K L}\left(q\left(x_T \mid x_0\right) \| p\left(x_T\right)\right)+\sum_{t=2}^T D_{K L}\left(q\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0\right) \| p_\theta\left(x_{t-1} \mid x_t\right)\right)-\log p_\theta\left(x_0 \mid x_1\right)\right) \end{aligned} $$

Certainly! Let me expand on that text and relate it to the equations, and then we'll walk through the next two lines of equations.

The text is saying that instead of minimizing the actual objective function L, we can minimize its upper bound $\bar{L}$, which is easier to work with. The upper bound $\bar{L}$ is derived using Jensen's inequality, as shown in the equations:

$$L \leq - \int q(x_0) \left(\int \log \left( \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right)q(x_{1:T}|x_0) dx_{1:T}\right)dx_0$$
$$L\leq - \int q(x_{0:T}) \log \left(\frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) dx_{0:T}$$
$$L \leq \mathbb{E}_q \left(- \log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) = \bar{L}$$

The text suggests that, theoretically, we can learn the parameters of the reverse process by iteratively sampling from the forward process (represented by $q(x_{0:T})$) and adjusting the parameters to minimize the negative log ratio $- \log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}$ in the upper bound $\bar{L}$.

However, the authors want to simplify the upper bound further to obtain a more convenient form. They do this in the next two lines of equations:

$$\bar{L} = \mathbb{E}_q \left(- \log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\right) = \mathbb{E}_q \left(- \log p_\theta(x_{0:T}) + \log q(x_{1:T}|x_0)\right)$$
$$= \mathbb{E}_q \left(- \log p_\theta(x_0|x_{1:T}) - \log p_\theta(x_{1:T}) + \log q(x_{1:T}|x_0)\right)$$

In the first line, they expand the log ratio using the logarithm property $\log(\frac{a}{b}) = \log(a) - \log(b)$.

In the second line, they apply the chain rule of probability to decompose $p_\theta(x_{0:T})$ into $p_\theta(x_0|x_{1:T})$ and $p_\theta(x_{1:T})$. This is because:

$$p_\theta(x_{0:T}) = p_\theta(x_0|x_{1:T})p_\theta(x_{1:T})$$

Therefore, $\log p_\theta(x_{0:T}) = \log p_\theta(x_0|x_{1:T}) + \log p_\theta(x_{1:T})$.

The authors will continue to manipulate this expression in the following equations to obtain a more tractable form of the upper bound $\bar{L}$, which will be easier to minimize during training.

Of course! Let's continue with the next few bits of math in the paper, being very precise and exact in replicating the equations and formulae.

Following the previous equations, the paper states:

The first term doesn't depend on μ_θ and Σ_θ and so doesn't need to be considered in the optimisation process. The last term is pretty self-explanatory and is not that hard to optimise. Finally, the remaining terms are KL divergence between gaussian distributions. Indeed, we already saw that

$$q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})$$

and we can show that

$$p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \sigma_t^2\mathbf{I})$$

where

$$\sigma_t^2 = \frac{1-\bar\alpha_{t-1}}{1-\bar\alpha_t}\beta_t$$

The KL divergence between 2 gaussian distributions having a closed form, we will see in the next section that this upper bound defines a very tractable loss function to be minimised for the training process.

In this part, the authors discuss the terms in the upper bound $\bar{L}$. They point out that the first term (which is $\mathbb{E}_q[-\log p_\theta(x_0|x_{1:T})]$) does not depend on the parameters of the reverse process (μ_θ and Σ_θ), so it can be ignored during optimization. The last term ($\mathbb{E}_q[\log q(x_{1:T}|x_0)]$) is straightforward and not difficult to optimize.

The remaining terms ($\mathbb{E}_q[-\log p_\theta(x_{1:T})]$) involve the KL divergence between Gaussian distributions. The authors remind us of the previously introduced equation for $q(x_t|x_0)$, which is a Gaussian distribution with mean $\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0$ and variance $(1-\bar\alpha_t)\mathbf{I}$.

They then introduce the equation for $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$, which is also a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ and variance $\sigma_t^2\mathbf{I}$, where $\sigma_t^2$ is given by:

$$\sigma_t^2 = \frac{1-\bar\alpha_{t-1}}{1-\bar\alpha_t}\beta_t$$

The authors mention that the KL divergence between two Gaussian distributions has a closed-form solution, which will lead to a tractable loss function for the training process, as will be discussed in the next section.

The formulas for the mean and variance of the reverse process, $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$, are derived from the properties of the forward diffusion process and the assumption that the reverse process is also a Gaussian transition with the same functional form as the forward process.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the forward diffusion process, the transition from a clean image $x_0$ to a noisy image $x_t$ is defined as:

   $q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})$

   where $\bar\alpha_t$ is the product of the noise schedule $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_t$, and $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.

2. Given $x_t$ and $x_0$, the transition probability $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ can be computed using Bayes' theorem:

   $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = \frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)}$

3. Assuming that the reverse process is also a Gaussian transition with the same functional form as the forward process, we have:

   $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_t(x_t, x_0), \Sigma_t)$

4. To find the expressions for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$, we need to match the first and second moments of the Gaussian distribution $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ with the moments derived from the forward diffusion process.

5. After some algebraic manipulation, we obtain the following expressions:

   $\mu_t(x_t, x_0) = \frac{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}\beta_t}{1-\bar\alpha_t}x_0 + \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t}(1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})}{1-\bar\alpha_t}x_t$

   $\Sigma_t = \frac{1-\bar\alpha_{t-1}}{1-\bar\alpha_t}\beta_t\mathbf{I}$

   where $\beta_t = 1 - \alpha_t$.

The derivation involves Gaussian identities, Bayes' theorem, and algebraic manipulations. The key idea is to match the moments of the reverse process with the moments derived from the forward diffusion process, assuming that both processes have the same functional form.

The resulting expressions for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$ ensure that the reverse process is consistent with the forward diffusion process and can be used to generate samples that follow the same distribution as the training data.

It's worth noting that the exact derivation of these formulas can be quite technical and involves a fair amount of algebra. If you're interested in the full derivation, I recommend checking out the appendix of the original diffusion models paper by Ho et al. (2020) or other resources that provide a detailed mathematical treatment of the topic.

Certainly! I'll walk you through the derivation of the formulas for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$ from the forward diffusion process. We'll start with the properties of the forward diffusion process and then use Bayes' theorem and Gaussian identities to arrive at the desired expressions.

Given:
- Forward diffusion process: $q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})$
- Reverse process: $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_t(x_t, x_0), \Sigma_t)$

Step 1: Expand the forward diffusion process using the definition of a Gaussian distribution.

$q(x_t|x_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(1-\bar\alpha_t)}}\exp\left(-\frac{(x_t - \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0)^2}{2(1-\bar\alpha_t)}\right)$

Step 2: Expand the reverse process using Bayes' theorem.

$q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = \frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)}$

Step 3: Expand $q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_0)$ using the definition of the forward diffusion process.

$q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})$
$q(x_{t-1}|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})\mathbf{I})$

Step 4: Substitute the expanded terms into the expression for $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$.

$q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = \frac{\mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})\mathbf{I})}{\mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})}$

Step 5: Use the Gaussian product rule to simplify the numerator. The Gaussian product rule states that the product of two Gaussians is proportional to another Gaussian:

$\mathcal{N}(x; \mu_1, \Sigma_1)\mathcal{N}(x; \mu_2, \Sigma_2) \propto \mathcal{N}(x; \mu_3, \Sigma_3)$

where:
$\Sigma_3 = (\Sigma_1^{-1} + \Sigma_2^{-1})^{-1}$
$\mu_3 = \Sigma_3(\Sigma_1^{-1}\mu_1 + \Sigma_2^{-1}\mu_2)$

Applying the Gaussian product rule to the numerator:

$\mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\alpha_t}x_{t-1}, (1-\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}x_0, (1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})\mathbf{I}) \propto \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_t(x_t, x_0), \Sigma_t)$

Step 6: Solve for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$ using the Gaussian product rule.

$\Sigma_t^{-1} = ((1-\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})^{-1} + ((1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})\mathbf{I})^{-1}$

$\mu_t(x_t, x_0) = \Sigma_t\left(((1-\alpha_t)\mathbf{I})^{-1}\sqrt{\alpha_t}x_t + ((1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})\mathbf{I})^{-1}\sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}x_0\right)$

Step 7: Simplify the expressions for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$.

$\Sigma_t = (\frac{1}{1-\alpha_t} + \frac{1}{1-\bar\alpha_{t-1}})^{-1}\mathbf{I}$

$\mu_t(x_t, x_0) = \Sigma_t\left(\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}{1-\alpha_t}x_t + \frac{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}}{1-\bar\alpha_{t-1}}x_0\right)$

Step 8: Use the fact that $\bar\alpha_t = \bar\alpha_{t-1}\alpha_t$ and $\beta_t = 1 - \alpha_t$ to further simplify the expressions.

$\Sigma_t = \frac{1-\bar\alpha_{t-1}}{1-\bar\alpha_t}\beta_t\mathbf{I}$

$\mu_t(x_t, x_0) = \frac{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}\beta_t}{1-\bar\alpha_t}x_0 + \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t}(1-\bar\alpha_{t-1})}{1-\bar\alpha_t}x_t$

And there you have it! We've derived the expressions for $\mu_t(x_t, x_0)$ and $\Sigma_t$ from the forward diffusion process using Bayes' theorem, Gaussian identities, and algebraic manipulations. The key steps were expanding the forward diffusion process, applying Bayes' theorem to express the reverse process, and using the Gaussian product rule to simplify the resulting expression.
