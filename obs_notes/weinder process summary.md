### Key Points of the Wiener Process:

1. **Mean of 0**:
    
    - The increments dWtdW_tdWt​ of the Wiener process have a mean of 0.
    - This means that, on average, there is no net directional movement. The process doesn't have a bias in any particular direction.
    - Over time, the expected value of WtW_tWt​ remains zero: E[Wt]=0E[W_t] = 0E[Wt​]=0.
2. **Variance**:
    
    - Each increment dWtdW_tdWt​ has a variance of dtdtdt, which is very small for an infinitesimal time interval.
    - However, these variances accumulate over time, leading to an overall variance of ttt for the process at time ttt: Var(Wt)=t\text{Var}(W_t) = tVar(Wt​)=t.
3. **Random Walk**:
    
    - The process describes a "random walk" where each step is independent of the previous ones.
    - This independence, combined with the normal distribution of each step, results in a path that wanders randomly over time.
    - Despite having no net drift, the path can move significantly away from the starting point due to the accumulation of these random steps.

### Illustration:

Imagine tracking the position of a particle undergoing Brownian motion. Here’s what you’d observe:

- **Short Time Intervals**:
    
    - In a very short interval dtdtdt, the particle moves a tiny, random amount, with equal likelihood of moving in any direction.
    - The mean displacement in this interval is zero, but the particle still moves due to the variance dtdtdt.
- **Over Time**:
    
    - As you sum up many such tiny intervals, the particle’s position starts to show a wandering path.
    - While each step is random and small, their cumulative effect causes the particle to drift away from the starting point.
- **No Overall Pattern**:
    
    - There is no predictable pattern of movement because the process is symmetric around zero. The particle is equally likely to move in any direction at each step.
    - Over a long period, the path resembles a random, unpredictable trajectory.

### Summary:

- The Wiener process is a mathematical model for random motion, where each increment has a mean of 0, implying no net directional movement.
- The increments have a small variance, but as these increments accumulate, the overall variance increases linearly with time.
- This results in a path that exhibits random wandering without a fixed pattern, capturing the essence of Brownian motion observed in physical particles.

So, the mean of 0 ensures that there is no systematic drift in any particular direction, while the variance causes the process to spread out over time, leading to the characteristic random wandering motion.
