The notation $\bar{\alpha}_t$ is defined as:
$$\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s$$

This is a product notation, where $\prod$ (capital pi) denotes the multiplication of a sequence of terms. In this case, it means that $\bar{\alpha}_t$ is the product of all $\alpha_s$ terms from $s=1$ up to $s=t$.

To understand this better, let's expand the product for a few steps:

For $t=1$:
$\bar{\alpha}_1 = \alpha_1$

For $t=2$:
$\bar{\alpha}_2 = \alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2$

For $t=3$:
$\bar{\alpha}_3 = \alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdot \alpha_3$

And so on.

In general, for any step $t$, $\bar{\alpha}_t$ is the product of all noise scaling factors $\alpha_s$ from the first step up to the current step $t$.

Recall that $\alpha_t$ is defined as:
$$\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$$

For $t=3$, we have: $$\bar{\alpha}_3 = \alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 \cdot \alpha_3$$

Now, let's substitute $\alpha_t$ with its definition:

$\alpha_1 = 1 - \beta_1$ $\alpha_2 = 1 - \beta_2$ $\alpha_3 = 1 - \beta_3$

Substituting these values into the expression for $\bar{\alpha}_3$: $$\bar{\alpha}_3 = (1 - \beta_1) \cdot (1 - \beta_2) \cdot (1 - \beta_3)$$

Expanding the multiplication: $$\bar{\alpha}_3 = (1 - \beta_1) \cdot (1 - \beta_2 - \beta_3 + \beta_2 \beta_3)$$ $$\bar{\alpha}_3 = 1 - \beta_1 - \beta_2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 - \beta_3 + \beta_1 \beta_3 + \beta_2 \beta_3 - \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3$$

This expansion shows that $\bar{\alpha}_3$ is a function of the noise scaling factors $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$. It represents the cumulative product of the "preservation" factors $(1 - \beta_t)$ from $t=1$ to $t=3$.

We can see that $\bar{\alpha}_3$ includes terms with individual $\beta_t$, products of two $\beta_t$, and the product of all three $\beta_t$. These terms account for the various combinations of noise added at each step.

In general, for any step $t$, $\bar{\alpha}_t$ will be a function of all the noise scaling factors $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_t$, and it will include terms with individual $\beta_t$, products of two $\beta_t$, products of three $\beta_t$, and so on, up to the product of all $t$ noise scaling factors.

The expanded form of $\bar{\alpha}_3$ illustrates how the cumulative product of the preservation factors $(1 - \beta_t)$ captures the overall effect of the noise added at each step of the diffusion process.


Where $\beta_t$ is the noise scaling factor at step $t$. So, $\alpha_t$ represents the amount of the original signal that is preserved at step $t$.

By taking the product of all $\alpha_s$ terms up to step $t$, $\bar{\alpha}_t$ represents the cumulative amount of the original signal that is preserved at step $t$. In other words, it is the product of the "preservation" factors from the first step to the current step.

The notation $\bar{\alpha}_t$ is useful because it allows us to express the distribution of $x_t$ in terms of the initial data $x_0$ and a single Gaussian noise term $\epsilon_t$, as shown in the equation:
$$x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$

Here, $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$ scales the initial data $x_0$, preserving the cumulative amount of the original signal up to step $t$, while $\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}$ scales the Gaussian noise term $\epsilon_t$, representing the cumulative amount of noise added up to step $t$.

I hope this explanation clarifies the meaning and purpose of the notation $\bar{\alpha}_t$ and how it works in the context of the diffusion model.
