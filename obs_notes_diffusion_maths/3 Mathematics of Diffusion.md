It is more accurate when describing the discrete diffusion process to refer to a 'Markov chain with guassian transition probability kernel'

I we denote $x_0$ a data from a distribution we want to sample from and $q(x_0)$ the distribution itself.

- $x_0$ represents a single data point sampled from the original data distribution that we aim to model.
- $q(x_0)$ denotes the true data distribution itself, from which $x_0$ is sampled.

**so $q(x_0)$ is the TRUE DATA distribution for x_0**

We define the forward process with gaussian transition probability (the diffusion kernel) as follows:
$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$

- This equation defines the forward diffusion process, which is a Markov chain with [[Gaussian transition probabilities]].
- $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ represents the conditional probability distribution of $x_t$ given $x_{t-1}$, where $t$ is the timestep index.
- The forward process gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data at each step, transforming it from the original distribution $q(x_0)$ to a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution.
- The transition probability is modeled as a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$, where:
  - The mean is given by $\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}$, which is a scaled version of the previous timestep's data $x_{t-1}$. The scaling factor $\sqrt{1 - \beta_t}$ controls the amount of noise added at each step.
  - The covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix with $\beta_t$ on the diagonal, denoted as $\beta_t \mathbf{I}$. This means that the noise added at each step is isotropic (i.e., independent and identically distributed along each dimension).
  - see [[specific choice of using square roots]] or the explanain of the cooefficients 

We can also write: $x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$ which is the same thing!

- This equation provides an alternative way to express the forward diffusion process.
- It utilises the [[reparamaterisation trick]]
- Instead of directly specifying the transition probability distribution, it describes how to generate $x_t$ from $x_{t-1}$ using a deterministic scaling term $\sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}$ and a stochastic Gaussian noise term $\sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon_t$.
- $\epsilon_t$ is a standard Gaussian noise vector sampled from $\mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.
- The scaling factor $\sqrt{1-\beta_t}$ controls the amount of the previous timestep's data $x_{t-1}$ that is preserved, while $\sqrt{\beta_t}$ controls the magnitude of the Gaussian noise added.

These equations lay the foundation for the forward diffusion process, which gradually corrupts the data by adding Gaussian noise at each step. The amount of noise added is controlled by the parameter $\beta_t$, which can be chosen to ensure a smooth transition from the original data distribution to a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution over the course of the diffusion process.

In the subsequent equations, the authors will build upon this forward process to define the reverse process and the training objective for the diffusion model. We'll go through those equations step by step as well to ensure a clear understanding.

The next key step is to intrpoduce $\alpha_t = (1-\beta_t)$ and use it to show how can [[get any step from the first step]] .

In the paper, the authors introduce a new notation $\alpha_t$ defined as:
$$\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$$
$$\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s$$

Using this notation, they show that any step $x_t$ can be directly sampled from $x_0$ using the following equation:
$$x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$

To derive this equation, they use a simple recurrence argument. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start with the reparameterized form of the transition probability distribution:
   $$x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$

2. Substitute $x_{t-1}$ with its expression in terms of $x_{t-2}$:
   $$x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} (\sqrt{\alpha_{t-1}} x_{t-2} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_{t-1}} \epsilon_{t-1}) + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon_t$$
      $$ = \sqrt{\alpha_t \alpha_{t-1}} x_{t-2} + \sqrt{\alpha_t(1 - \alpha_{t-1})} \epsilon_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon_t$$

3. Continue this substitution process recursively until reaching $x_0$:
   $$x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t \alpha_{t-1} \ldots \alpha_1} x_0 + \sqrt{\alpha_t \alpha_{t-1} \ldots \alpha_2 (1 - \alpha_1)} \epsilon_1 + \ldots + \sqrt{\alpha_t(1 - \alpha_{t-1})} \epsilon_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon_t$$
      $$ = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \tilde{\epsilon}_t$$

   where $\tilde{\epsilon}_t$ is a weighted sum of the noise terms $\epsilon_1, \ldots, \epsilon_t$.

4. The authors note that $\tilde{\epsilon}_t$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance $\mathbf{I}$, as it is a sum of independent Gaussian random variables. Therefore, we can replace $\tilde{\epsilon}_t$ with a single noise term $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$:
   $$x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon_t \text{ with } \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$$
   See [[summing guassian variables]]

This derivation shows that any step $x_t$ in the diffusion process can be directly sampled from the initial data $x_0$ using a simple equation that involves the cumulative product of the noise scaling factors $\bar{\alpha}_t$ and a single Gaussian noise term $\epsilon_t$.

The key insights from this section are:
1. The introduction of the notation $\alpha_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t$ simplifies the expressions and makes the derivation more concise.
2. The recurrence argument demonstrates how each step $x_t$ can be expressed as a function of the initial data $x_0$ and a series of Gaussian noise terms.
3. The final equation provides a direct way to sample $x_t$ from $x_0$ without the need to iteratively sample from the transition probability distributions.

This result is important as it gives a closed-form expression for the distribution of $x_t$ given $x_0$, which will be used later in the derivation of the training objective and the sampling process of the diffusion model.

The next section in the paper states:

From the Markov property, we can write the probability of a given forward trajectory as
$$q(x_{0:T}) = q(x_0) \prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t | x_{t-1})$$

Let's rewrite and explain this section in more detail.

The notation $x_{0:T}$ represents the entire forward trajectory of the diffusion process, starting from the initial state $x_0$ and ending at the final state $x_T$. It includes all the intermediate states $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{T-1}$.

The equation states that the probability of observing a specific forward trajectory $x_{0:T}$ can be factorized into a product of two terms:
1. The probability of the initial state $x_0$, denoted as $q(x_0)$.
2. The product of the conditional probabilities of each step $x_t$ given the previous step $x_{t-1}$, denoted as $\prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t | x_{t-1})$.

This factorization is a direct consequence of the Markov property, which states that the probability of the next state $x_t$ depends only on the current state $x_{t-1}$ and not on any earlier states.

Let's break down the equation further:
- $q(x_{0:T})$ represents the probability of observing the entire forward trajectory $x_{0:T}$.
- $q(x_0)$ is the probability of the initial state $x_0$, which is the same as the data distribution we want to model.
- $\prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ is the product of the conditional probabilities $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ for each step $t$ from 1 to $T$. Each term $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ represents the transition probability from state $x_{t-1}$ to state $x_t$, which is modeled as a Gaussian distribution with mean $\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}$ and variance $\beta_t \mathbf{I}$.

The Markov property allows us to write the probability of the entire trajectory as a product of these terms because it implies that each step $x_t$ depends only on the previous step $x_{t-1}$. This property simplifies the expression of the probability and makes it more tractable for analysis and computation.

By factorizing the probability of the forward trajectory into a product of conditional probabilities, we can more easily work with the diffusion process and derive the necessary equations for training and sampling from the model.

me: What does it mean to talk about 'the probabiolity of a given forward tajectory?'
amnsw:
When we talk about "the probability of a given forward trajectory," we are referring to the likelihood of observing a specific sequence of states in the forward diffusion process.

In the context of the diffusion model, a forward trajectory is a sequence of states $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_T)$ that represents the evolution of the data from the initial state $x_0$ to the final state $x_T$. Each state $x_t$ corresponds to a noisy version of the data at timestep $t$.

The probability of a given forward trajectory quantifies how likely it is to observe that specific sequence of states, starting from $x_0$ and ending at $x_T$, under the diffusion process defined by the model.

To understand this better, let's consider an example:
- Suppose we have a diffusion model trained on a dataset of images.
- A forward trajectory $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_T)$ would represent a specific sequence of noisy images, starting from a clean image $x_0$ and progressively adding noise at each timestep until reaching the final noisy image $x_T$.
- The probability of this forward trajectory, denoted as $q(x_{0:T})$, measures how likely it is to observe this specific sequence of noisy images under the diffusion process.

The probability of a forward trajectory is determined by two factors:
1. The probability of the initial state $x_0$, which is the same as the data distribution we want to model. This is denoted as $q(x_0)$.
2. The transition probabilities between consecutive states, which are modeled as Gaussian distributions. The transition probability from state $x_{t-1}$ to state $x_t$ is denoted as $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$.

The Markov property allows us to factorize the probability of the entire trajectory into a product of these two factors:
$$q(x_{0:T}) = q(x_0) \prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t | x_{t-1})$$

This factorization simplifies the computation of the probability and makes it more tractable for analysis and training of the diffusion model.

In summary, the probability of a given forward trajectory measures the likelihood of observing a specific sequence of states in the forward diffusion process, starting from the initial data and progressively adding noise at each timestep. It is a key quantity in the mathematical formulation of the diffusion model and plays a crucial role in the training and sampling procedures.

me: But what is the probability of the initial state???? like wqhat could q(X_0) be?
answ:
The probability of the initial state, denoted as $q(x_0)$, refers to the probability distribution of the original clean data that we want to model using the diffusion process.

In the context of the diffusion model, $x_0$ represents a sample from the original data distribution, before any noise is added. The distribution $q(x_0)$ captures the inherent structure, patterns, and variations present in the clean data.

The specific form of $q(x_0)$ depends on the type of data being modeled and the assumptions made about its distribution. In most practical applications, the true distribution of the clean data is unknown, and we only have access to a finite set of samples from that distribution (i.e., the training dataset).

Here are a few examples of what $q(x_0)$ could be:

1. **Empirical distribution**: In this case, $q(x_0)$ is defined as the empirical distribution of the training data. Each sample in the training set is assumed to be an independent draw from $q(x_0)$. The probability of a specific $x_0$ is proportional to its frequency in the training set.
2. **Gaussian distribution**: If the clean data is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, $q(x_0)$ would be a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a certain mean and covariance matrix. The parameters of the Gaussian distribution could be estimated from the training data.
3. **Mixture of distributions**: In some cases, the clean data might be better described by a mixture of different distributions. For example, $q(x_0)$ could be a mixture of Gaussian distributions, where each component represents a different cluster or mode in the data.
4. **Implicit distribution**: In many applications, the exact form of $q(x_0)$ is not explicitly defined. Instead, the diffusion model learns to approximate $q(x_0)$ implicitly through the training process. The model learns to generate samples that are similar to the training data, effectively capturing the underlying distribution.

In practice, the diffusion model does not need to explicitly model $q(x_0)$. Instead, it learns to generate samples from the clean data distribution by learning to reverse the diffusion process, starting from random noise and gradually removing the noise to obtain clean samples.

The probability of the initial state $q(x_0)$ serves as a starting point for the forward diffusion process. It represents the distribution of the clean data that we aim to model and generate using the diffusion model. The specific form of $q(x_0)$ depends on the assumptions made about the data and can be either explicitly defined or implicitly learned through the training process.

me:But it doesn't matter because we always use specific instances? like we don' actually every need to know or use an actual value of Q(x0:T)?
answe:
You're absolutely right! In practice, we don't need to explicitly compute or use the actual value of $q(x_{0:T})$ for training or sampling from the diffusion model.

The probability of a given forward trajectory, $q(x_{0:T})$, is a theoretical concept that helps us understand and formalize the diffusion process. It provides a mathematical framework for reasoning about the model and deriving the necessary equations for training and sampling.

However, when it comes to the actual implementation and use of the diffusion model, we work with specific instances of the data rather than directly manipulating the probability distributions.

During training, we typically have a dataset of clean examples ${x_0^{(1)}, x_0^{(2)}, ..., x_0^{(N)}}$ that are assumed to be sampled from the real data distribution $q(x_0)$. We use these examples to learn the reverse diffusion process, which maps noisy instances back to clean instances.

The training process involves the following steps:

1. Sampling a clean example $x_0$ from the dataset.
2. Applying the forward diffusion process to $x_0$ to obtain a noisy instance $x_t$ at a randomly chosen timestep $t$.
3. Using the diffusion model to estimate the noise that was added to $x_t$, and learning to predict the clean example $x_0$ from the noisy instance $x_t$.
4. Updating the model parameters based on the difference between the predicted and actual clean examples.

During sampling, we start from a random noise sample $x_T$ and use the trained diffusion model to gradually denoise it, step by step, until we obtain a clean sample $x_0$. This process does not require explicitly computing $q(x_{0:T})$.

The probability distributions, such as $q(x_{0:T})$ and $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$, are used to define the diffusion process and derive the training objectives. However, in practice, we work with specific instances of the data and use the learned diffusion model to map between noisy and clean instances.

So, you're correct that we don't need to compute or use the actual values of $q(x_{0:T})$ in the practical implementation of the diffusion model. The probability distributions serve as a theoretical foundation, but the actual training and sampling processes operate on specific instances of the data.

The paragraph following the equation emphasizes that the Markov property is a crucial aspect of the diffusion process, as it enables this factorization and simplifies the mathematical formulation of the model.

I hope this explanation clarifies the meaning and significance of the equation $q(x_{0:T}) = q(x_0) \prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ and the role of the Markov property in the context of the diffusion model. Let me know if you have any further questions!
