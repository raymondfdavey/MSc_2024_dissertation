No worries, it's important to clarify these concepts! Let's discuss how the random variables, probability distributions, and transition probabilities work in the case of multivariate Gaussians, which are commonly used in diffusion models.

In the multivariate case, the random variable $X_t$ represents a vector of values at timestep $t$. For example, if we are dealing with images, $X_t$ could represent the pixel values of an image at timestep $t$. Each component of $X_t$ corresponds to a pixel or a feature of the data.

The probability distribution $q(X_t)$ in the multivariate case is a multivariate Gaussian distribution. It is characterized by a mean vector $\mu_t$ and a covariance matrix $\Sigma_t$. The mean vector $\mu_t$ represents the center or average value of the distribution, while the covariance matrix $\Sigma_t$ captures the relationships and variability between the different components of $X_t$.

In the diffusion process, the transition probability $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ is also modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. It describes the probability of transitioning from a specific vector $x_{t-1}$ at timestep $t-1$ to a vector $x_t$ at timestep $t$. The transition probability is defined by a mean vector and a covariance matrix, which are functions of $x_{t-1}$ and the diffusion model parameters.

Recall that in the univariate case, the transition probability was defined as:

$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t)$

In the multivariate case, the transition probability is defined similarly, but with vector and matrix quantities:

$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$

Here, $\sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}$ is the mean vector of the multivariate Gaussian, which is a scaled version of the previous timestep's vector $x_{t-1}$. The covariance matrix is $\beta_t \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. This means that the noise added at each timestep is independent and identically distributed across all components of $X_t$.

To generate a specific realization of $X_t$ in the multivariate case, we sample from the multivariate Gaussian distribution $q(X_t)$. This involves drawing a vector from the distribution, where each component of the vector is sampled according to the corresponding marginal Gaussian distribution.

The diffusion process in the multivariate case defines a sequence of multivariate random variables $X_0, X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_T$, each associated with a multivariate Gaussian distribution $q(X_0), q(X_1), q(X_2), \ldots, q(X_T)$. The transition probabilities $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ define how these distributions evolve over time, gradually transforming the complex initial distribution $q(X_0)$ into a simpler isotropic Gaussian distribution $q(X_T)$.

The key difference between the univariate and multivariate cases is that in the multivariate case, we are dealing with vectors and matrices instead of scalar values. The random variables, probability distributions, and transition probabilities are all defined in terms of multivariate Gaussians, which capture the relationships and dependencies between the different components of the data.

I hope this explanation clarifies how the concepts of random variables, probability distributions, and transition probabilities extend to the multivariate case in the context of diffusion models. Let me know if you have any further questions!
